Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room would like to develop a web-based game that can operate on multiple platforms as they are currently availablbe only on Androids.  So this software should be comptable for mobible devices such as Apple and Google, as well as PC's and Laptops.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did well in convincing the client to utilize a cloud-based approach to host their web application as it is scalable and more affordable.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It lays the groundwork for the project such as highlighting the software requirements and goals of the client, as well as mentionining the potential obstacles the development team may face.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would add more detail to the evaluation portion as there can be plenty of other details I may have missed regarding different operating systems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user needs instant image upload for the game to work which can be attributed to the cloud-based system we implemented.  It's important because if the user does not receive the images in a timely manner, the game is unplayable.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

By creating a reliable application with high uptime, the user can easily create a game with friends and play whenever they have internet access as well as a mobile device.  If the game becomes popular, we would need to scale the program more and having a framework that supports this is crucial.
